                    <p class="blog-post-text">I decided to take a look at my portfolio site I was working on again I had stopped for awhile because I ran into issues and was unable to fix them so I took a break. I was able to fix these issues I was having with my photos by putting a height inline attribute but then ran into a strange git problem where the name of my file is not the same name on github after I pushed the code. So my picture is not showing on github pages at the moment. Although this should not be very difficult to fix I thought it would be worth documenting due to it being a odd problem. </p>

I created a git repo that way I can keep track of my learning. I also have been trying out this new website that teaches you some of the more advanced git commands, I feel these are all important skills to have to be a developer.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">So I met with Carol today and after a week of me struggling to get my database models and other parts of my code in a separate folder and file, she was able to walk me through it and get my app up and running. I learned a lot from this even though it was her that got it running for me I understand a lot more about how my app is running and how to achieve this next time I need to do this, so it was a win all around.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I have found out that what I am experiencing with my flask app and separating my code is called circular import where you have objects that need to be global and rely on other objects so when you split your code up you split up objects that rely on other objects so you get a kind of dead lock. I am going to research some more and figure out the best way to accomplish this. I am not comfortable with blueprints to try on my app thats in production yet so, I will probably clone it and try that way so I don't do any damage I can not fix. </p>

So far from what I have seen and read this is going to take a lot of refactoring of code, I will document my progress and any struggles I come across along the way.

                    <p class="blog-post-text">So I decided to move all my database model classes into a separate file that way my code would not be so busy and look more professional. While doing that I ran into some problems getting it to work properly, I am almost 100% it has to do with the way I am importing but I ended up getting frustrated and walked away for awhile and will come back to it later. It just seemed like the more I did the worst things got so probably best to try again tomorrow.</p>

I really did not know where to start when it was first suggested so she has given me some good ideas to get this started. To start with I am going to put my User and Post classes in a separate file and then move my error functions in their own file after that I will see how my code looks and try to see some other things I can do to clean it up some more.</p>

Now I have also decided to work on making the look of the app more professional, things like the home page not being so plain with nothing on it etc., so if someone happens to come across my app online it will look more user friendly than it does now. I know the learning I take away from building the app is more important than looks but I also take pride in what I do so some minor improvements I think is important also.</p>

With a little research was able to find a solution by using this command heroku git:remote -a example-app. So overall it was a success and a learning experience but does not explain why it keeps losing the repo from time to time.</p>

When using SQLALCHEMY 1.4 the database URI has to have postgresql:// instead of postgres://, which is what the heroku command line gives you to use when you type the command in to get the path to the database, so that is very frustrating. I had to sign in to heroku in browser destroy the database and go through the process again except when I copy and pasted the path into my app.py file I just changed the beginning of the path to postgresql://, not very complicated just some research and a lot of patience, guess that come with the territory of software development.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">Got an answer back from someone on slack. I had my body element height set to 100vh when the body was actually longer than the view port, so I changed the height to 100% and the width to 100vw to avoid overflow plus I was able to delete .container margin-top.

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I have been learning a lot in the past month.I Wasn't able to fix the issue with the blog, although I did fine tuning the break points on the media queries along with adjusting the top and left margins it is a lot better than it was, I still need some more adjustments and maybe some guidance from someone that knows more than me. I have also been learning how to use git for version control and was introduced to github issues. Next project will be to add a admin page to my flask app.</p>

I hope this blog will help someone else new to programming and give you an idea of what to expect when you start this journey. <span>GOOD LUCK, HAPPY CODING!!!</span> </p>

                <p class="blog-post-text">I have decided to document the journey of a student who wants to become a software developer. This blog will hold nothing back. I will explain the hardships and failures as well as the great things that keep us coming back to the world of software development. I hope this blog will help someone else new to programming and give you an idea of what to expect when you start this journey. <span>GOOD LUCK, HAPPY CODING!!!</span> </p>

                <p class="blog-post-text">I have ran into my first problem to write about, hence the reason for starting this blog. I am having trouble with my media queries for different screen sizes, the top of my page is getting cut off and the picture is not changing sizes to fit the screen. I am going to do some research online and will document how I end up fixing the problem.</p>

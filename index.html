                <p class="blog-post-text">I have decided to document the journey of a student who wants to become a software developer. This blog will hold nothing back. I will explain the hardships and failures as well as the great things that keep us coming back to the world of software development. I hope this blog will help someone else new to programming and give you an idea of what to expect when you start this journey. <span>GOOD LUCK, HAPPY CODING!!!</span> </p>

                <p class="blog-post-text">I have ran into my first problem to write about, hence the reason for starting this blog. I am having trouble with my media queries for different screen sizes, the top of my page is getting cut off and the picture is not changing sizes to fit the screen. I am going to do some research online and will document how I end up fixing the problem.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-text">I have been learning a lot in the past month.I Wasn't able to fix the issue with the blog, although I did fine tuning the break points on the media queries along with adjusting the top and left margins it is a lot better than it was, I still need some more adjustments and maybe some guidance from someone that knows more than me. I have also been learning how to use git for version control and was introduced to github issues. Next project will be to add a admin page to my flask app.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-text">I finally broke down and asked for help for my blog issue and posted it in slack, so far no one has offered any help. It is very frustrating not being able to figure this out.</p>
                <p class="blog-post-text"> I added an Admin page to my flask app and have been working hard on it everyday and I am learning a lot working on this app. Looking forward to being able to deploy it on the internet.</p>

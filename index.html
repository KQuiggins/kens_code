                    <p class="blog-post-text">I was able to deploy my Django app as a docker container with Heroku. This was a one of the most complicated thing I have done in software development. There are still a lot of things that need to be done to the app, things I never realized you need to think of when deploying an app. Things like image uploads and sending emails all these things have to setup and a lot of the times with third party apps and integrated into your app. So I will do some research on these topics and try to get them working in my local environment before I push it to production.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I had stopped my containers from running so that I could go meet Carol for our meeting after I came back and tried to start them up I kept getting an error saying something was already bound to the port. I ran netstat after making sure nothing else was running on my system and kept seeing a weird service connecting on localhost digging deeper into the problem I finally found that an extensions called portainer from docker I installed was connected on the port Django was set to in my docker-compose file. This was not an easy find I am glad I know how to use my terminal to troubleshoot problems like this.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I decided to learn how to use uuid to obfuscate the book id in the url of the bookstore app. It was actually a lot simpler than I imagined it would be. The only problem I ran into was I already had three books with data persisted in my database with id's instead of uuid's. So I just removed the old migrations and my PostgreSQL volume mount that still had old data and started migrations over. If this had been something other than a local development of my own I would have looked for another way to handle this and not destroyed customer data.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">The Django project I have been working on using docker has really been a fun learning experience for me. I added django-allauth to my project to handle all the logging in and out which I think is awesome because that is something you do not want to mess up and can easily turn into to a security issue. If there is one thing I take very seriously is cybersecurity and have always had a passion for web development and a secure internet.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I ran into a problem while developing a Django app using Windows Subsystem for Linux. Apparently the permissions for some of the files and folders if you create them in Ubuntu and you are working in vsCode are set to Root and this will not allow you to edit and save your progress. At first I had no idea what EAccess error I was getting was, after some research, found you need to change owner and change group of the folder you are working in with (chown -R [user] [folder/file]) and (chgrp -R [user] [folder/file]) after that you should be able to edit and save your progress. Hope this helps someone that runs into this problem. Happy Coding!!!!</p>

I was able to debug an issue with connecting my Postgresql database with Django because Psycopg2-binary version in the book does't work with python 3.10.4, so I feel super accomplished building my first docker image with Postgreql and Django, my skills are growing everyday.</p>

I was going over some HackerRank problems with Carol and just completely drew a blank and it really made me feel stupid but it also opened my eyes to the fact I need to work on that because I am used to coding by myself but in the real world I will have to be with a team of programmers. Life lessons are great!</p>

I was able to fix these issues I was having with my photos by putting a height inline attribute but then ran into a strange git problem where the name of my file is not the same name on github after I pushed the code. So my picture is not showing on github pages at the moment. Although this should not be very difficult to fix I thought it would be worth documenting due to it being a odd problem. </p>

I am going to research some more and figure out the best way to accomplish this. I am not comfortable with blueprints to try on my app thats in production yet so, I will probably clone it and try that way so I don't do any damage I can not fix. </p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I have done a few more things to my app like added a profile picture to the actual blog post and now the admin can delete and edit anyone's post. Now I have also decided to work on making the look of the app more professional, things like the home page not being so plain with nothing on it etc., so if someone happens to come across my app online it will look more user friendly than it does now. I know the learning I take away from building the app is more important than looks but I also take pride in what I do so some minor improvements I think is important also.</p>

I have a year left of school then I have to get a job if I am not at the point I am hireable by then I will probably be stuck getting a job in a field I will be miserable in, so I pray everyday I will make it because I love to code and everything about the tech field.

With a little research was able to find a solution by using this command heroku git:remote -a example-app. So overall it was a success and a learning experience but does not explain why it keeps losing the repo from time to time.</p>

I am only saving the name of the picture in the database and using werkzeug.utils import secure_file name to secure the name in the database then saving the picture locally in the images folder. Will probably do something different in the future.</p>

When using SQLALCHEMY 1.4 the database URI has to have postgresql:// instead of postgres://, which is what the heroku command line gives you to use when you type the command in to get the path to the database, so that is very frustrating. I had to sign in to heroku in browser destroy the database and go through the process again except when I copy and pasted the path into my app.py file I just changed the beginning of the path to postgresql://, not very complicated just some research and a lot of patience, guess that come with the territory of software development.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I have decided to document the journey of a student who wants to become a software developer. This blog will hold nothing back. I will explain the hardships and failures as well as the great things that keep us coming back to the world of software development. I hope this blog will help someone else new to programming and give you an idea of what to expect when you start this journey. <span>GOOD LUCK, HAPPY CODING!!!</span> </p>

I am having trouble with my media queries for different screen sizes, the top of my page is getting cut off and the picture is not changing sizes to fit the screen. I am going to do some research online and will document how I end up fixing the problem.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I have been learning a lot in the past month.I Wasn't able to fix the issue with the blog, although I did fine tuning the break points on the media queries along with adjusting the top and left margins it is a lot better than it was, I still need some more adjustments and maybe some guidance from someone that knows more than me. I have also been learning how to use git for version control and was introduced to github issues. Next project will be to add a admin page to my flask app.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I finally broke down and asked for help for my blog issue and posted it in slack, so far no one has offered any help. It is very frustrating not being able to figure this out.</p>
                    <p class="blog-post-text"> I added an Admin page to my flask app and have been working hard on it everyday and I am learning a lot working on this app. Looking forward to being able to deploy it on the internet.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">Got an answer back from someone on slack. I had my body element height set to 100vh when the body was actually longer than the view port, so I changed the height to 100% and the width to 100vw to avoid overflow plus I was able to delete .container margin-top.

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I have been working with flask a lot lately and added a few new features like an Admin section, Rich text editor, profile picture, I ran into a little problem with the image uploading part I did what the flask documentation said to do and watched some tutorials but still get a permission denied error which seems like a file permission error due to windows settings I will have to due some more research. I also started a bootstrap project which is going really well so far.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I decided to deploy my app on heroku. When you do that you can not use sqlite or MySQL as a database, so I went with postgres, everything went smooth until it was time use the heroku python terminal and actually set up the database for the tables I created. I keep getting an error, so I will do some research and document how I end up fixing the error.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">I was able to get my database up and working properly not without some frustrations. When using SQLALCHEMY 1.4 the database URI has to have postgresql:// instead of postgres://, which is what the heroku command line gives you to use when you type the command in to get the path to the database, so that is very frustrating. I had to sign in to heroku in browser destroy the database and go through the process again except when I copy and pasted the path into my app.py file I just changed the beginning of the path to postgresql://, not very complicated just some research and a lot of patience, guess that come with the territory of software development.</p>
